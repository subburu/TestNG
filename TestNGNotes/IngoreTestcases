How to ignore tests in TestNG?

Ignore the specific test Methods?
Ignore all the test methods in testNG class?
Ignore all the test methods in a package ?

To specifically disable the testcases 

Package class methods 
@Test method

TestNG class if any class is having at least one test method t
hen that class is called as TestNG class

We can ignore the testcases at 
package level
Class level 
Method level

Ignoring and disabling are both same 

@Ingnore tag has highest priority compared to enabled =true 
if it is enabled =true , it will not execute the test case.


@Ignore all the  tests in the class by placing @Ignore all in the class level.
 package-info.java file need to be created and @Ignore should be mentioned 
 above the package name
