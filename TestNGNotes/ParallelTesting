Parallel Execution with DataProvider in TestNG?

1.How to execute tests parallely with DataProvider?

2.How to control the thread count when using data provider?


if you have 100 test cases and just using parallel attribute , 
then 100 times browser will be opened and execution gets struck due to network.

So,we need to have control where we can set the value for data provider 
How many sets of data we need send parallel ,we can control using thread-count

You cannot specify the data provider thread-count inside the class.
We need to specify the thread-count in xml file
