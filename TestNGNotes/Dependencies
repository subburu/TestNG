How to create the test dependencies in TestNG?

1.What is test dependency ? Why we need test dependencies?
Test depended on another test - then we need to use dependencies



2.How to create a test dependency on other tests?
 
3.what happens when priority is set to the set method?
priority will not be consider ,when we use test dependency 
priority will be ignored 

what happens when depended test is failed?
Test case will be moved into the skip state
Even though dependency test case fails we need to run the test case then will use 
alwaysRun = true
what happens when depended test is ignored /skipped /deleted?
The test cases will not be executed, we will get testNG exception


1.Create shipment 
2.Track shipment -- tracking number
3.Cancel Shipment -- tracking number

tracking number is the relation between the test cases 
if tracking number is not available then executing 2 and 3 test cases are 
of no use 

if create shipment is failed -- its waste of time in executing 
other test cases Track ship and cancel shipment to avoid these we use dependencies

Dependencies can applied for 
Testmethods 
Testgroups

Dependencis take string [] arrays {}

Dependencies methods will have high priority
