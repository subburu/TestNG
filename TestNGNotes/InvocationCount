How to use Invocation count ,Invocation timeout & Threadpool size in TestNG?

@Test annotation -- many attributes are available 
1.What is Invocation count?
Invocation count is used to execute the same test case multiple times with out using any 
forloop.
for example you want to create 10 new records --  create record test case can be executed 10 times.

@Test(invocationCount=5)
invocatoinCount is  an attribute 
even if test cases fails due to sync issue in second time , it will continue to execute  third time

2.Why do we need Invocation count?
To execute the same test case multiple times

3.How to use invocation count?
@Test(invocationCount=5)

4.What is Invocation timeout ?
invocation timeout is similar to timeout -- the test cases gets failed if the 
invocation timeout gets execeed.


5.How do we use invocation timeout?

@Test(invocationCount=5 ,timeOut =1000)

6.What is ThreadPool size?
What ever the invocations your planning you can mention the thread-pool 
How many number of threads you want to execute 

@Test(invocationCount=5 ,threadpoolSize =2)

ThreadPool is similar to thread-count in parallel testing 
ThreadPool can be used only for Invocation count
