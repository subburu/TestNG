Execute your tests in parallel using TestNG

1.Sequential  -- One after the other 
2.Parallel  --  Side by Side 

1.What is parallel execution ?
Sequential execution -- sequential order 
Parallel -- executing test cases side by side -- to save the time 
 
2.Why do we need parallel execution?
To Save the time -- we use parallel execution 

5 test cases  
1st  5mins
2nd 10 mins 
3rd 15 mins 
4th 10 mins total  30mins in sequential execution 
But when your executing side by side max time will be 15.
1st case takes 5 mins 
2nd take 10 mins

3.How to perform the parallel execution ?

Thread is nothing but a process inside the java

We need to use parallel execution we need to use xml file 

Two attributes we need to use for parallel execution 
at suite level or test level
1. Parallel 
2. Thread count 

parallel value = false / none -- then thread-count is not consider -- sequential execution
if thread-count =1 , then test cases will be executed in sequential order only 

if you provide negative number to thread count -- illegal Argument exception will be thrown
thread-count=-1;

parallel=tests and thread-count ="2"

parallel execution should always be used in suite level not in the test level
<suite name="Suite" parallel="tests" thread-count="2">
  <test  name="Test1" parallel="tests" thread-count="2"> -- this does not make sense as it applicable to particular test1
  
  Note : Thread-count is use full when we are executing the test cases in parallel
