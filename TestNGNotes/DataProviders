DataProviders in TestNG

What is DataProvider how to use it in TestNG?

Data provider is a container which can provide different sets of test data.
To avoid the hard coded values.
To parameterize  test data we need to use Data provider.


2.How to use data  provider ?
We don't want to hard cord the test data , we need to use data provider
@Dataprovider 


3.What happens if we don't provide a name to data provider?
it will throw the exception , to overcome the exception we can use the method name 

We need to pass different inputs for login , from outside of the method
Same test case with multiple times using multiple sets of data 

1.What is DataProvider and why we need to use data provider?
Data provider is used to parameterize the data 


When we dont have data provider name , we can use the method name 

Generally we use getData method for the data provider

Parameters of Test Method and return types of Data provider ?


1.It is mandatory to return  object[][] from data provider?
It is not mandatory to return object [][]

2.What are the return types of a data provider?
object[] (single dimensional array)
object[][] (double dimensional array)
Iterator <Object>
Iterator <Object[]>

Object -- any data type -- predefined data /user data type 
Predefined 
String 
Integer 
float 
Employee[]
Object is super class of all the classes , so we use object.

How to use the data provider partially in TestNG?
1.What is indices ? why do we use indices?
0,2 indexes of array are called indices

2.How to use indices?
To  pass the paritally data 
3.What happens if we don't use the indices?
Entire test data will be used by default
